# Interview Questions

A collection of programming interview questions I use during technical interviews, implemented in C.

## Purpose

This folder contains:
- Common interview questions and coding challenges
- Reference solutions with explanations
- Test cases and edge cases to consider
- Notes on what I look for in candidate responses

## Structure

Each question includes:
- Problem statement
- Solution implementation
- Time/space complexity analysis
- Discussion points for interviews

## Usage

These solutions serve as:
- Reference implementations for interview preparation
- Examples of clean, efficient C code
- Practice problems for improving C skills
- Benchmarks for evaluating candidate solutions
