# C Learning Journey

A personal repository documenting my journey learning C programming from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

## Overview

This repository contains exercises, projects, and notes as I progress through learning C. The goal is to build a strong foundation in systems programming and understand how computers work at a lower level.

## Structure

```

├── basics/          # Hello World, variables, data types, operators
├── control-flow/    # if/else, loops, switch statements
├── functions/       # Function definitions, recursion, scope
├── pointers/        # Pointer fundamentals and memory management
├── arrays-strings/  # Arrays, strings, and string manipulation
├── structs/         # Structures and unions
├── file-io/         # File operations and I/O
├── advanced/        # Dynamic memory, linked lists, algorithms
└── projects/        # Mini-projects and practical applications
```

## Learning Goals

- Master C syntax and core concepts
- Understand memory management and pointers
- Build efficient, readable code
- Complete practical projects
- Prepare for systems programming

## Progress

- [x] Basic syntax and data types
- [ ] Control structures
- [ ] Functions and scope
- [ ] Pointers and memory
- [ ] Data structures
- [ ] File I/O
- [ ] Advanced topics

## Resources

- The C Programming Language (K&R)
- Antirez (Salvatore Sanfilippo) C Course: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrEMgOSrS_3cFJpM2gdw8EGFyRBZOyAKY
- Online tutorials and documentation

## Compilation

Most programs can be compiled with:
```bash
gcc -O2 -Wall -W filename.c -o output
./output
```
